# Dark Loading Screen

A simple mod to make the loading screen darker.

Requires the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net).

Also available [on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-loading-screen) or as a [resource pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/dark-loading-screen) (using [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/)).



## Color configuration

Colors can be modified in-game using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) in 1.16.2 and later. Changing the Mojang logo color is only supported in 1.16 and later.

### Manual configuration

Create or edit `[minecraft folder]/config/dark-loading-screen.json`. The default config is
```json
{
    "background": "14181c",
    "bar": "e22837",
    "barBackground": "14181c",
    "border": "303336",
    "logo": "ffffff"
}
```

Manual changes are only visible after restarting the game.
