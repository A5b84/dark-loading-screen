# Dark Loading Screen

A simple [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod to make the loading screen darker.

## Color configuration

Colors can be modified in-game if both [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) are installed.

### Manual configuration

Create or edit `.minecraft/config/dark-loading-screen.json`, the default config is
```json
{
    "background": "14181c",
    "bar": "e22837",
    "barBackground": "14181c",
    "border": "303336",
    "logo": "ffffff",
    "fadeIn": 1.0,
    "fadeOut": 2.0
}
```

Manual changes are only visible after restarting the game.
