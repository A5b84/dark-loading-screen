# Dark Loading Screen

A simple [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net) mod to make the loading screen darker.

## Color configuration

Colors can be modified in-game in 1.16.2 and later if both [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) are installed. Changing the Mojang logo color is only supported in 1.16 and later.

### Manual configuration

Create or edit `.minecraft/config/dark-loading-screen.json`. The default config is
```json
{
    "background": "14181c",
    "bar": "e22837",
    "barBackground": "14181c",
    "border": "303336",
    "logo": "ffffff"
}
```

Manual changes are only visible after restarting the game.
